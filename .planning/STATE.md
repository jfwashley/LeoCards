## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Next.js 15 + Better Auth + Drizzle + Neon + PixiJS 8.x + Motion 11.x + DeepL + Vitest + Biome (see research/SUMMARY.md)
- Architecture: Compute-on-read — habitat level, decay, mood, and milestones derived at request time from raw DB facts; never stored as computed columns
- Study: Client-local session state via `useReducer`; single batch POST to `/api/study/complete` at session end

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-made word list data source not yet identified — must resolve before Phase 2 planning (A1-B1 French/Spanish/English frequency list needed)
- Milestone thresholds (exact schedule beyond 10/25/50/100 examples) are a product design decision — resolve during Phase 6 planning
- Sprite assets (tiger/idle/happy/sad/sleep, habitat layers, animal sprites) must be in hand before Phase 5 — art production or licensing not yet arranged
- PixiJS 8.x sprite atlas toolchain specifics need validation at Phase 5 start (recommend `/gsd:research-phase` before Phase 5)
